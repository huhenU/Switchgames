Here are some games you can play in the Switch internet Browser using the SwitchBru DNS.
If you get an error saying "page not found" you either just loaded the page when I was adding a new game and you tried to launch it from the main-page or, if parts of a game work, that part is not finished yet or it may be a bug.

For now I am aware that some things in Minesweeper are not working but the base features are fine so that is low-priority on my list.
If you encounter an issue in another game that is not marked as "not working yet" please contact me somewhere
